-camera calibration can be done with ArUco

-less bits, the farther the camera can detect, but less possibilities to represent markers
	- dictionary to describes and maps possibilities

- white border space arround marker


implementation pass:
- declare a detector
	- each frame detect and draw a list os all markers in frame
		- show frame


- set detection mode:
	- slower but precise mode - normal mode - adaptative treshold
	- faster but less precise mode - fast mode - convolution
	- small markers, faster, videos - video fast mode
